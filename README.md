For IOS Users, the method i have found most consistent for being able to use this code well is to use the shortcuts app, I'll give a quick little walkthrough here.
1. Open the 'Shortcuts' app and create a new shortcut.
2. In this shortcut, add a text block.
3. Paste the html code into this text block.
5. Then add an 'Open URL s'.
6. In this Open URL s clear the text variable, and type "data:text/html," and then choose the text variable just above the keyboard.
